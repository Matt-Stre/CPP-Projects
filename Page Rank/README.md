This project involved creating a custom page rank. It involves a formula to determine which nodes in a graph are more important than others. This is similar to how current search engines work. The program take in an integer input that determines the number of lines that will be entered. Then following lines have two strings seperated by a space. These strings are the "from" website and the "to" website respectively.
